## AI Agent Types
An "agent" is an automated reasoning and decision engine. The key agent components can include, but not limited to:
- Break down of a complex question into smaller ones
- Choosing an external tool to use and coming up with parameters for calling the Tool
- Planning out a set of tasks
- Storing previosuly completed tasks in a memory module.

### When to Use Agents
Agents are highly beneficial when tasks require complex decision-making, autonomy, and adaptability. They excel in environments where the workflow is dynamic and involves multiple steps or interactions that can benefit from automation.
### When Not to Uss Agents
- Tasks that are straightforward, infrequent, or require minimal automation.
- Tasks that require deep domain-specific knowledge and expertise, e.g., legal or medical advice.
- Tasks that require a high level of human empathy, creativity, or subjective judgement, e.g., psychotherapy.
## AI Agent Frameworks
Three prominent frameworks for building AI agents are:
- [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen)
- [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI)
- [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph)
