## AI Agent Types
An "agent" is an automated reasoning and decision engine. The key agent components can include, but not limited to:
- Break down of a complex question into smaller ones
- Choosing an external tool to use and coming up with parameters for calling the Tool
- Planning out a set of tasks
- Storing previosuly completed tasks in a memory module.
