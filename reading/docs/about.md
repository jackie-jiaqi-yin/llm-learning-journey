## About This Documentation

This documentation site is a collection of personal learning notes on Large Language Models, AI Agents, and related topics. The notes are organized using a "topic online clustering" approach, where content is added whenever interesting insights are discovered.

## Note-Taking Philosophy

This means:

- **Real-time capture**: Notes are added as I learn, not in a rigid structure
- **Organic organization**: Topics emerge and evolve naturally
- **Personal focus**: Content reflects my learning journey and interests
- **Continuous evolution**: The documentation grows and improves over time
