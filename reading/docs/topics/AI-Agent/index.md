# AI Agents

AI Agents are autonomous systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. In the context of Large Language Models, AI agents leverage the reasoning and generation capabilities of LLMs to perform complex tasks.

## What's in This Section

### [Overview & Frameworks](notes.md)
- What are AI Agents and when to use them
- Three prominent frameworks: AutoGen, CrewAI, LangGraph
- Comparison of different agent architectures
- Lists of open-source agents and tools

### [Paper Reviews](paper-review.md)
Detailed reviews of cutting-edge research papers:
- **LAMBDA**: A Large Model Based Data Agent
- **Can Large Language Models Serve as Data Analysts?**
- **TaskWeaver**: A Code-First Agent Framework

## Key Concepts

- **Autonomous Execution**: Agents can break down complex tasks and execute them step-by-step
- **Tool Use**: Integration with external tools and APIs
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Multiple agents working together on complex problems
- **Code-First Approaches**: Agents that generate and execute code to solve problems

## Popular Frameworks

| Framework | Best For | Key Features |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| **AutoGen** | Multi-agent conversations | Easy agent communication, flexible roles |
| **CrewAI** | Task delegation | Role-based agents, built-in collaboration |
| **LangGraph** | Complex workflows | State management, graph-based execution |
