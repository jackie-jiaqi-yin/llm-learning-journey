    "# Day 2 - Document Q&A with RAG using LlamaIndex\n",
    "\n",
    "Two big limitations of LLMs are 1) that they only \"know\" the information that they were trained on, and 2) that they have limited input context windows. A way to address both of these limitations is to use a technique called Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG. A RAG system has three stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Indexing\n",
    "    2.  Retrieval\n",
    "    3. Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing happens ahead of time, and allows you to quickly look up relevant information at query-time. When a query comes in, you retrieve relevant documents, combine them with your instructions and the user's query, and have the LLM generate a tailored answer in natural language using the supplied information. This allows you to provide information that the model hasn't seen before, such as product-specific knowledge or live weather updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will use Azure OpenAI with ChromaDB as the vector store. ChromaDB is an open-source embedding database that makes it easy to store and query document embeddings. We'll use LlamaIndex as the framework to tie everything together."
